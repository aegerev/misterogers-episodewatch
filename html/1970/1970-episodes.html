            <h2>1970</h2>
            <p>In 1970, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was in its third season, airing on the National Educational Television (NET) network, which later became the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The show's filming location remained in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and it was produced by Small World Enterprises and WQED. The season was notable as the last to air on NET before the network's rebranding. </p>
